### About Me

I specialize in leading full-stack development from concept to deployment, with a strong focus on building high-quality, scalable web and mobile applications. My current role involves architecting and maintaining production systems, managing CI/CD pipelines, and guiding teams through best practices and code reviews.  

### What I Bring to the Table

- 6+ years of hands-on experience developing and maintaining production-grade applications using **React, React Native, Node.js, and TypeScript**.  
- Proven ability to design and deploy **end-to-end features** focused on performance, reliability, and maintainability.  
- Practical experience integrating **wallet connections, smart contracts, and blockchain interactions** (Polygon, Ethereum) with **Solidity, ethers.js, and Web3.js**.  
- Solid foundation in **cloud infrastructure (AWS)**, **containerization (Docker)**, and **databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Supabase)**.  
- Committed to **clean architecture, automation**, and optimizing **developer workflows through CI/CD and automated testing**.  

Recently, I’ve been deepening my expertise in **Web3 development**, having deployed tokens and DApps on mainnet, and contributed to freelance projects integrating **crypto payments**
